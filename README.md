# MoonLamboDoge69DeFiSuperSwapperPro

c'est mon premier open source repo

it was intended to be a solana portfolio viewer which ended up with a bunch of ray v4 swaps and other util functions. kinda cool, give it a try ;)

fill up yo deets in config file and run using **flet run** or **python app.py**

its not complete/perfect but it does the job. 

becareful while running burn tokens or close token account functions. 

**read the code and understand what any function does before aping in blindly. use at yo own risk**


**license: do whatever the fuck you want at your own risk**
